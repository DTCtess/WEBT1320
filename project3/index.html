                        <h2>Traditional Style Eagle and Snake</h2>
                        <img src="images/eagle.png" alt="eagle">
                        <p> An eagle who has caught a snake and is in a mid-air fight styled in Old School lines and colors.Traditional snake tattoos are known as representing a don't-tread-on-me sensibility, thus warding off evil, misfortune and danger. The eagle and the snake both are powerful symbols. This original art would make a striking tattoo.</p>

                        <h2>Medusa</h2>
                        <img src="images/medusa.png" alt="medusa">
                        <p> This Neo-Traditional Medusa will make a breathtaking tattoo. It is meant to be large and bold! Medusa was a mythological Gorgon who had venomous snakes in place of her hair. It was said that she could turn people to stone by merely looking at them. This would make a great tattoo!

                        <p> This tattoo is a Neo-Traditional style wolf with a snake, two sabers, and some lush greenery. The quote, from a Dylan Thomas poem titled "Do not go gentle into that good night" is motivational and inspiring. This would make a good tattoo on the back or the stomach.</p>
